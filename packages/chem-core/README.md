# @chemdraft/chem-core

Owns the native document model, schema versions, migrations, validation, serialization, and patch application.

This package must not import UI, Tauri, Ketcher, RDKit, plugin loading, or filesystem APIs.

The MOL writers require an explicit `kekuleBondOrders` map and return `{ contents, warnings }`.
Callers resolve orders through layout-engine; this package cannot depend on it. An empty or partial
map preserves unmapped aromatic bonds as type 4 and returns one warning per ring system, naming its
atoms. Every consumer must surface those warnings through its operation's warning path.

Unknown bond orders write as CTfile type 8 (any) in both formats, with one warning naming all
affected bond ids. This preserves the native unknown order on reimport, but readers treat it as a
query bond with no chemical order. Chemistry and 3D engine callers pass `unknownBondOrders: "refuse"`; this
throws the exported `UnknownBondOrderError` with `bondIds` before any output or warnings are emitted.
