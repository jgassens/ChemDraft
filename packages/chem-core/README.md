# @chemdraft/chem-core

Owns the native document model, schema versions, migrations, validation, serialization, patch application, and native style presets (including `DocumentStylePreset`).

This package must not import UI, Tauri, Ketcher, RDKit, plugin loading, or filesystem APIs.

Crossing identity compares an unordered pair of structured `{ objectId, bondId }` references;
delimiters inside either ID are literal characters. Validation and patch application share these
comparisons. Saved crossings already use structured references, so existing documents load without
a schema change or key migration.

The MOL writers require an explicit `kekuleBondOrders` map and return `{ contents, warnings }`.
Callers resolve orders through layout-engine; this package cannot depend on it. An empty or partial
map preserves unmapped aromatic bonds as type 4 and returns one warning per ring system, naming its
atoms. Every consumer must surface those warnings through its operation's warning path.

Unknown bond orders write as CTfile type 8 (any) in both formats, with one warning naming all
affected bond ids. This preserves the native unknown order on reimport, but readers treat it as a
query bond with no chemical order. Chemistry and 3D engine callers pass `unknownBondOrders: "refuse"`; this
throws the exported `UnknownBondOrderError` with `bondIds` before any output or warnings are emitted.
