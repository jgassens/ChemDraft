# ChemDraft Plans

This file describes **the slice currently in flight** — nothing else. Completed slices move to
`docs/shipped/README.md` when they land, so that an agent told to "follow PLANS.md" gets the work
in progress rather than a changelog.

# In flight: pKa applicability, and the analyzers tail

The analyzers slice shipped and moved to
[`docs/shipped/analyzers-property-prediction-suite.md`](docs/shipped/analyzers-property-prediction-suite.md).
What remains open from it:

- **The prospective applicability protocol**, `docs/benchmarks/pka-applicability-prospective-protocol.md`.
  §7 — the rule deciding when a prediction is shown with an interval, without one, or not at all — is
  deliberately blank, and the evaluation set it will be judged on has not been assembled. Order of
  operations is enforced by three commits in sequence: the sealed set's hash, then the rule, then the
  scores. Writing the rule after seeing the set voids the result.
- **OpenClatura silent omission.** A validated patch exists at `docs/benchmarks/openclatura-patch`; it
  has not been submitted upstream.
- **The pKa model itself is frozen** at SHA-256 `79061c4d…`. Model research is stopped, not paused for
  lack of ideas: the measured gap is not where feature or optimizer work reaches. Reopening it needs a
  reason recorded here first.

# Known open items (not in flight)

No other slice is in flight on `main` right now. These are standing gaps left by the toolbar,
palette, and arrow bug-fixes slice (shipped 2026-08-02, PR #26, merge `2fa4c21` — see
`docs/shipped/README.md`), not active work. One of its three original open items has since been
fixed; it is not repeated here.

1. **Art inspector still styles only graphics and molecules.** `ArtInspectorStyleObject` is
   `GraphicObject | MoleculeObject` (`apps/desktop/src/artInspectorModel.ts:156`), so Color
   Controls and Object Settings route a bracket or mechanism-arrow selection to a status message
   rather than a working panel. Widening it is its own slice.
2. **Stale comment in the CDXML importer.** `packages/cdx-compat/src/index.ts:2261` says
   equilibrium and retrosynthesis "stay the legacy `reaction-arrow` object until they're migrated
   in a later pass" — they were migrated in `6ccb9086` and `cf3c3569`, and the condition on the
   line below already routes all four kinds to `importReactionArrowAsArtArrow`. Only `unknown` is
   legacy now. One-line comment fix.

(Fixed since: the third original open item — that electron-pushing arrows were art, not mechanism
annotations, and `tool.mechanismArrow` was a retired stub — was resolved 2026-08-12 by PR #32,
merge `a4477da`. `tool.mechanismArrow` and `tool.mechanismFishhook` are now live, atom/charge-anchored
`mechanism-arrow` document objects; see `docs/shipped/README.md`. `packages/mechanism-tools` is
still only shared types, but the working feature lives in `chem-core`, `documentWorkflow.ts`, and
`layout-engine`, not that package.)

Other work in flight lives on its own branches (for example `claude/image-input`) and carries its
own plan; this file does not describe work scoped to a branch other than `main`.

Repo-wide scope lives in `PLAN.md`. One further scoped plan applies inside its area:
`PLAN-spin3d-forcefields.md` (Phase 3 blocked on owner decisions). The selection-architecture plan
finished and moved to `docs/shipped/selection-policy-refactor.md`.
