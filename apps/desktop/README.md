# ChemDraft Desktop

Tauri v2, Vite, React, and TypeScript desktop shell for ChemDraft.

`pnpm dev` launches the Tauri desktop app. `pnpm dev:web` remains available as a secondary browser preview for React shell work.

This shell is intentionally compact and document-centered: native app menu, dense quick-action toolbar, page workspace, native floating icon-first palette, hidden-by-default utility panels, and status bar. It now includes a narrow lazy Ketcher host for active selected-molecule editing, but it does not include native file dialogs, native clipboard handling, full RDKit, CDXML/CDX, or MolScribe OCSR inference yet.

The desktop palette is a separate Tauri window behind `src/window-manager`. Palette buttons route command IDs back to the main document window, where the existing command registry invokes them. `pnpm dev:web` keeps an in-window docked palette only as a browser-preview fallback.
